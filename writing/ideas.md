# Five Ideas
# Group members Andrew Rankins Bell

1) Create a simple text based game- Using user input, I could create a simple
dungeon crawler where you battle monsters. I would be making a classic game
where the user has to choose what to do.

2) Create a musical track using Jfueg- I would implement a program that plays
music when prompted. I would use the random class to create orignal pieces.

3) Create a story telling program- This is similar to how in class we used coding
to create a madlib. I would create an orignal story that incorporates user input.

4) Create a virtual Board Game- I have a fascination with video games so I figured
that this would be a nice introduction to actually designing that.

5) Create a Quiz- I do not have an idea of what the material on the quiz would be.
A simple quiz would be a cool way to implement javascript.
