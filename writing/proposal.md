# Project Proposal
# Group members Andrew Rankins Bell

I want to create a simple text-based game where I am able to simulate a dungeon
crawler.Dungeon crawlers are where the player fights their way through a dungeon and loots.The inspiration for wanting to create this program comes from my fascination with video games as a whole. As a child I have always wondered what
it would be like to make my very own video game where someone can be who they truly
want to be. I was involved in programs such as Tiger Woods Video Game Design and
I really enjoyed being able to tinker with an unfinished game. The game would
involve the player creating their character by choosing their name. After that the
player would then explore a dungeon. In this dungeon the player would have to fight
monsters while the monster fights the player back. My motivation for making this
game a dungeon crawler was because I am a big fan of role playing games.

This project is feasible in the scope of our class because some of the main methods that would be implemented would be while loops and if else statements. The while loop would allow for enemies to be beaten before being able to proceed.  the if else statements would be used to provide various inputs depending on the situation. Examples of a text based game from stackoverflow.com show that the if else statements would be able to be used to have multiple options for users or players to choose. I am hoping that this project will be able to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. The game making process can be a very time consuming process. I will have to break this project into sections so that I am able to be as time efficient as It possibly be. I will be using all available resources to be able to complete this assignment.

The website gamedev.stackexchange.com gives a breakdown of what can be implemented to be able to create a good text based game. If else statements are very important
for being able to read in user input with an action being attached to that input.
Input and output are also going to need to be closely watched because the user
input is going to determine a lot of how the user experience is going to be
moving forward. The output is going to be how the game interacts with the player.
Other Java programing concepts that would be implemented possible could be the
creation of constructors and the scanner class could be used heavily. The scanner
class would be the connection between the input of the user and the output of the
program. There would probably be a set amount of choices which the user has to
chose between in order to progress.
